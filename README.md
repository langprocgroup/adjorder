Calculate MI between adjectives and nouns in Google Syntactic n-grams and use that to predict adjective order.

Data in the two `.csv` files is from Scontras et al. (2017).

Data in `english_adjectives.txt` and `english_nouns.txt` is from CELEX.

The remaining data files, containing the actual count data and pmi calculations for adjectives and nouns, are too large to put on Github. Until I find a place to put them, you can contact me for these files at `rfutrell@uci.edu`.
